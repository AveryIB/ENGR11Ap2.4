        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Class one, Our Environment</h1>
        <h2> We pulled all of our materials out to prepare to build.</h2>
        <img src="Layout.jpg" alt="Layout" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">XZ+Y Axis</h1>
        <h2>The two main components of the build, the hotplate and the Y axis, were prepared to put together.</h2>
        <img src="XZ+Y.jpg" alt="XY+Z" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Motor Box</h1>
        <h2>This image shows the inside of the motorbox for the Y axis.</h2>
        <img src="XZ+Y.jpg" alt="XY+Z" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Connecting</h1>
        <h2>We connected the XZ and the Y axis to form the printer.</h2>
        <img src="Connected.jpg" alt="Connected" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Filament holder</h1>
        <h2>Next, we built the filament holder, which allows filament to constantly feed into the printer.</h2>
        <img src="FilamentHolder.jpg" alt="Filament Holder" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Assembled</h1>
        <h2>This shows the fully assembled 3D Prusa Mini+.</h2>
        <img src="Assembled.jpg" alt="Assembled" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Class three, our set-up</h1>
        <h2>This showcases the plans to run the Benchy torture test.</h2>
        <img src="Environment.jpg" alt="Environment" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Printed Benchy</h1>
        <h2>Here, the challenge was to decrease printing time. What better way than to make it smaller?</h2>
        <img src="Printing.jpg" alt="Printing" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Second Benchy</h1>
        <h2>This time, we altered some of the settings to attempt to optimize print time for the regular size, and also decrease stringing..</h2>
        <img src="AltBenchy.png" alt="Settings" style="width:800px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Comparison</h1>
        <h2>Comparing the mini with another print we did, this time with a full-sized Benchy, we can see that the printer works well either way!</h2>
        <img src="Comparison.jpg" alt="Comparison" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Front View</h1>
        <h2>Another comparison; here you can see some slight stringing. Again, this is mostly due to the temperature of the environment, not necessarily a fault of the printer.</h2>
        <img src="SideViewBenchie.jpg" alt="Side View" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Class four, Printing a Shell</h1>
        <h2>For this class, we could download any creative commons 3D model, and I chose a small shell pot, since it would only take 38 minutes to print, leaving me with plenty of time to set up a larger project later on.</h2>
        <img src="ShellPrinting.jpg" alt="Printing Shell" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Finished Shell</h1>
        <h2>Finished Shell! Again, pretty stringy on the inside, but it functions well, and the design on the outside is very clean-cut. Another successful print!</h2>
        <img src="Shell.jpg" alt="Shell" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Making A Cord Taco</h1>
        <h2>For my big project, I used a Thingiverse taco croc charm and TinkerCAD to create a cord taco, which is a holder for cords. This is a functional build that incorporates my love for tacos.</h2>
        <img src="Cutout.png" alt="Cutout" style="width:800px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Ready to Print</h1>
        <h2>This is the finalized model which I used to print. I'm using a filament with multiple different colors blended in, and the whole print should take about 6 hours and be about 7 inches wide and 4 inches tall.</h2>
        <img src="TacoModel.png" alt="Ready to Print" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Finished Product!</h1>
        <h2>Featuring a prism pattern on the outside, this cord taco came out just as expected!</h2>
        <img src="CordTaco.jpg" alt="Cord Taco" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Bottom View</h1>
        <h2>Although, I hadn't expected the pattern on the bottom. This is due to the lack of support, though supports aren't necessary for the structure here.</h2>
        <img src="BottomView.jpg" alt="Bottom View" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Class Five, Mixing programs.</h1>
        <h2>For this class I used multiple programs including Thingyverse, TinkerCAD, Fusion360, and MeshMixer to create a Halloween-themed cat pot.</h2>
        <img src="CatSketch.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Now that I had sketched out an idea, I made it a reality with TinkerCAD.</h1>
        <h2>For this part, I downloaded a pot from Thingyverse, as I knew it'd be difficult to create a functioning pot from scratch.</h2>
        <img src="Pot.png" alt="Pot" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Now I added multiple simple shapes. </h1>
        <h2>At this step, it was important to ensure all of the shapes were connected solidly. Everything had to be aligned on the same plane, with no gaps, or else the print would fail, or make a mess. This was a complicated project; I incorporated many shapes and some of them put material on the inside of the pot, so I attempted to troubleshoot by putting a half-sphere set to "hole" inside the pot. This worked to an extent.</h2>
        <img src="NewForm.png" alt="Form" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">I decided to put my name on it.</h1>
        <h2>This part was easier than you might imagine on TinkerCAD, they have many options for text, and the option to make an object a hole rather than a solid is present for text as well. I did have to be careful to not set the engraving to go through the bottom of the pot, however, and this observation was done carefully in the first few layers of slicing on Prusa.</h2>
        <img src="EngravingCAD.png" alt="Engraving" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">The results were awesome!</h1>
        <h2>Though I scrapped the original idea of having a face, the cat looked very well done. Stringing was also minimal, though it could be due to the shape I'm thinking perhaps the printer being older or more calibrated might come into play.</h2>
        <img src="CatFront.jpg" alt="Front View" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <img src="CatSide.jpg" alt="Side View" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">The engraving worried me at first.</h1>
        <h2>Since I used natural supports, some were put on the bottom of the design. When I pulled it off the printer, I hadn't even thought that the supports would fill in the engraving, so I was pretty scared when I realized they did. However, they were calibrated well, and with the assistance of some needle-nosed pliers they came out easily, leaving behind a perfect, clean engraving.</h2>
        <img src="Engraving.jpg" alt="Engraving" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">The lid proved to be more of a challenge.</h1>
        <h2>I had originally stacked two octogons on a circle to represent the lid of a pumpkin, but in print it didn't look much like a pumpkin lid at all. The main problem was function, though. I had printed a flat circle, no lip or groove, the same size as the openning of the pot. Needless to say, that didn't fit.</h2>
        <img src="OGLid.HEIC" alt="Lid" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Back to CAD.</h1>
        <h2>This time, I realized that it was imperative to include a lip for the lid to stay on. I added that in TinkerCAD, then started playing with Fusion360 and MeshMixer to get a smoother, more realistic shape.</h2>
        <img src="Lid3.0.png" alt="Sketch" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <img src="MeshFail.png" alt="Sketch" style="width:800px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <img src="MeshLid.png" alt="Sketch" style="width:850px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Finished Print.</h1>
        <h2>I was optomistic at first glance of this part. The geometric surface pattern was pretty, the overall shape was fantastic, and the lid supports looked like they worked really well.</h2>
        <img src="LidSupports.png" alt="Lid with Supports" style="width:450px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Removing the Supports.</h1>
        <h2>I was pretty worried that I wouldn't get all of the supports off. As you can see, they printed very close together and were difficult to remove.</h2>
        <img src="SupportLid.jpg" alt="Removal" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Finished Lid.</h1>
        <h2>However, I continued to remove the supports carefully, and after nearly an hour of painstaking work with a pair of pliers, I had success. Well, the good kind of success, at least.</h2>
        <img src="CleanLid.jpg" alt="Finished" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Completion.</h1>
        <h2>Finally, project 2 was completed. I successfully used multiple programs to create a satisfactory product. I leanred to use MeshMixer, TinkerCAD, and Fusion360 harmoniously, and I got some hands-on practice cleaning a print after it came off of the prusa.</h2>
        <img src="FinishedCat.jpg" alt="Complete" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
