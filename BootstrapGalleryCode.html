        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Class four, Printing a Shell</h1>
        <h2>For this class, we could download any creative commons 3D model, and I chose a small shell pot, since it would only take 38 minutes to print, leaving me with plenty of time to set up a larger project later on.</h2>

        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Finished Shell</h1>

        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Making A Cord Taco</h1>
        <h2>For my big project, I used a Thingiverse taco croc charm and TinkerCAD to create a cord taco, which is a holder for cords. This is a functional build that incorporates my love for tacos.</h2>
        <img src="Cutout.png" alt="Cutout" style="width:800px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Ready to Print</h1>
        <h2>This is the finalized model which I used to print. I'm using a filament with multiple different colors blended in, and the whole print should take about 6 hours and be about 7 inches wide and 4 inches tall.</h2>
        <img src="TacoModel.png" alt="Ready to Print" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Finished Product!</h1>
        <h2>Featuring a prism pattern on the outside, this cord taco came out just as expected!</h2>
        <img src="CordTaco.jpg" alt="Cord Taco" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Bottom View</h1>
        <h2>Although, I hadn't expected the pattern on the bottom. This is due to the lack of support, though supports aren't necessary for the structure here.</h2>
        <img src="BottomView.jpg" alt="Bottom View" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Class Five, Mixing programs.</h1>
        <h2>For this class I used multiple programs including Thingyverse, TinkerCAD, Fusion360, and MeshMixer to create a Halloween-themed cat pot.</h2>
        <img src="CatSketch.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Now that I had sketched out an idea, I made it a reality with TinkerCAD.</h1>
        <h2>For this part, I downloaded a pot from Thingyverse, as I knew it'd be difficult to create a functioning pot from scratch.</h2>
        <img src="Pot.png" alt="Pot" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Now I added multiple simple shapes. </h1>
        <h2>At this step, it was important to ensure all of the shapes were connected solidly. Everything had to be aligned on the same plane, with no gaps, or else the print would fail, or make a mess. This was a complicated project; I incorporated many shapes and some of them put material on the inside of the pot, so I attempted to troubleshoot by putting a half-sphere set to "hole" inside the pot. This worked to an extent.</h2>
        <img src="NewForm.png" alt="Form" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">I decided to put my name on it.</h1>
        <h2>This part was easier than you might imagine on TinkerCAD, they have many options for text, and the option to make an object a hole rather than a solid is present for text as well. I did have to be careful to not set the engraving to go through the bottom of the pot, however, and this observation was done carefully in the first few layers of slicing on Prusa.</h2>
        <img src="EngravingCAD.png" alt="Engraving" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">The results were awesome!</h1>
        <h2>Though I scrapped the original idea of having a face, the cat looked very well done. Stringing was also minimal, though it could be due to the shape I'm thinking perhaps the printer being older or more calibrated might come into play.</h2>
        <img src="CatFront.jpg" alt="Front View" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <img src="CatSide.jpg" alt="Side View" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">The engraving worried me at first.</h1>
        <h2>Since I used natural supports, some were put on the bottom of the design. When I pulled it off the printer, I hadn't even thought that the supports would fill in the engraving, so I was pretty scared when I realized they did. However, they were calibrated well, and with the assistance of some needle-nosed pliers they came out easily, leaving behind a perfect, clean engraving.</h2>
        <img src="Engraving.jpg" alt="Engraving" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">The lid proved to be more of a challenge.</h1>
        <h2>I had originally stacked two octogons on a circle to represent the lid of a pumpkin, but in print it didn't look much like a pumpkin lid at all. The main problem was function, though. I had printed a flat circle, no lip or groove, the same size as the openning of the pot. Needless to say, that didn't fit.</h2>
        <img src="OGLid.HEIC" alt="Lid" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Back to CAD.</h1>
        <h2>This time, I realized that it was imperative to include a lip for the lid to stay on. I added that in TinkerCAD, then started playing with Fusion360 and MeshMixer to get a smoother, more realistic shape.</h2>
        <img src="Lid3.0.png" alt="Sketch" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
        <br></br>

        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Finished Print.</h1>
        <h2>I was optomistic at first glance of this part. The geometric surface pattern was pretty, the overall shape was fantastic, and the lid supports looked like they worked really well.</h2>
        <img src="LidSupports.png" alt="Lid with Supports" style="width:450px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Removing the Supports.</h1>
        <h2>I was pretty worried that I wouldn't get all of the supports off. As you can see, they printed very close together and were difficult to remove.</h2>
        <img src="SupportLid.jpg" alt="Removal" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Finished Lid.</h1>
        <h2>However, I continued to remove the supports carefully, and after nearly an hour of painstaking work with a pair of pliers, I had success. Well, the good kind of success, at least.</h2>
        <img src="CleanLid.jpg" alt="Finished" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Completion.</h1>
        <h2>Finally, project 2 was completed. I successfully used multiple programs to create a satisfactory product. I learned to use MeshMixer, TinkerCAD, and Fusion360 harmoniously, and I got some hands-on practice cleaning a print after it came off of the prusa.</h2>
        <img src="FinishedCat.jpg" alt="Complete" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h1 style="color: yellow;">Project 3</h1>
        <h2>For this project, we needed to solder a working alarm clock, then create a fitted case to hold the board. My partner and I started by setting up our space and exploring our materials.</h2>
        <img src="BlankBoard.jpg" alt="Blank Board" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <h2>Soldering was an awesome experience. It took a few minutes and tries to assess the best position and procedure, but after that I was able to solder many rows and, with my partner, finish putting all the resistors in the board.</h2>
        <img src="Soldering.jpg" alt="Soldering" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <img src="FinishedRow.jpg" alt="Finished Row" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <h2>I did encounter one issue, where the trace on the back of the board lifted. This was solved by creating a manual bridge with the lead of one resistor to connect them, rather than using the tracer. Once I had finished soldering, I connected the battery to the board. The minute display wasn't lighting properly, because there was a bridge between two resistors where there shouldn't be. Removing the bridge allowed the clock to work properly.</h2>
        <img src="WorkingClock.jpg" alt="Working Clock" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h2>Now it was time to focus on the case for the alarm clock. We cycled through the idea of a cube die, a television, then finally, a storybook. We consistantly wanted to include a changeable date option to add to the clock.</h2>
        <img src="Idea1.jpg" alt="Cube Die" style="width:500px;height:500px;">

        <img src="Idea3.jpg" alt="Storybook" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br></br>
        <h2>Now that we had settled on our design, we input it to Fusion360. This part was tricky for a few reasons. It was challenging to articulate our ideas, then moreso to put them into a rendering. My partner is proficient in Fusion360, so I learned a lot working with them.</h2>
        <img src="BookPrint1.png" alt="Book Design" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
        <h2>However carefully we took our measurements, in print, it didn't quite fit. The button holes were to high, the buzzer hole was a little tight, and the hole for the clock numbers was also too short. We were expecting the need for iteration, though.</h2>
        <img src="BackFit.jpg" alt="Back Print" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <img src="FrontFit.jpg" alt="Front Print" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <br>
         <h2>Shifting back to our overall design, we wanted to include a drawer to hold that numbers that weren't being used. So I creaded this in Fusion, then printed it in Raise 3D, since the print was too large for the Prusa plate. We also decided to put a groove in the top of the draw so that our "book" holding the clock face and date would fit snuggly on top and not slide around.</h2>
        <img src="GroovedTop.png" alt="Grooved top" style="width:600px;height:500px;">
        <br> 
        <h2>Since I used the Raise for the first time, I wasn't sure how to calibrate the supports. I chose to keep them on the automatic setting, which turned out to be very excessive.</h2>
        <img src="DrawerSupports.jpg" alt="Drawer Supports" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
        <br>
        <h2>After a lot of elbow grease from myself and my partner, we managed to remove all of the supports and determined that the drawer slid in and out perfectly.</h2>

        <img src="DrawerClosed.jpg" alt="Drawer Closed" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
        <br>
        <h2>Finally, our clock was complete. The draw slid in and out, and with some hot glue (a useful resource, I learned) the pegs functioned well. Every mechanic worked, with some possible tweaks, but well nonetheless.</h2>

        <h2>Time to build a prosthetic hand! I was super excited for this project. The first step was to download the parts and take a look at the set up.</h2>
        <img src="NormalScale.png" alt="Normal Scale" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
        <br>
        <h2>This shows the normal set-up. As you can see, the entire kit could be printed on the Raise3D in one print (albeit one that would take 26 hours). However, we weren't using this scale. We were printing in 150%, which increased the needed surface area. Here, you can see how I arranged the parts so they'd fit nicely across two separate prints. Since this design didn't have any major overhangs, I didn't have to use any supports, so I printed them on default printer settings.</h2>

        <h2>Sadly, I didn't make it that easy for myself. As part of a homework assignment, I thought about how I could make this hand more useful. What I came up with sounds a lot like training wheels, in theory. The idea is that there would be a set of wheels, one on each side of the hand, so that when a user rests the hand on a table or surface, they can glide it smoothly along. This mechanism would greatly assist new users, as coordination is somethign that grows over time. Much like how we used TinkerCAD before Fusion, using wheels for a while would help clients transition more smoothly, and break fewer things. (Yes, the analogy still applies.) </h2>

        <br>
        <h2>There turned out to be a few problems with this idea. The first was the strength of the axle. I wasn't super worried about this, as I wouldn't be user testing and my purpose was to put my idea in PLA. The second was remembering the necessary functions of the hand. Unfortunately, I forgot that e needed to keep channels clear within the hand in order to string the fingers. So I accidentally put a box (to hold the axle) in front of the thumb channel. Finally, in print, I needed tree supports to hold up the axle, which inadvertantly clogged every single channel. Reprint. This time, the supports turned out pretty well. Or at least, they would've, had the layer shift not caused them to be a stringy mess.</h2>

In the first photo, one of the tabs was a few millimeters off, making it not fit in the hole and shifting the shelf to cause the entire box to not fit. The second photo shows that the tabs cannot be put at an equal position on each side, because the holes on the back and those on the shelf are not an equal distance from the corner. </h2>

One worry I do have is that we might not have the proper hardware. I believe that we'll have everything we need from the previous hand build, though.</h2>
