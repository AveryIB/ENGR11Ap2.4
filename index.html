        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Project 1
    </p>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In our first class, we covered introductions, syllabus details, and began a project. This set the tone for all of our classes, where we spent some time in the beginning covering review and new knowledge, then progressed to a hands-on project. We modeled user-focused design thinking with a bias towards additive solutions. The group that I was in decided to create a chair for "Grandpa" from the Simpsons.We split into small groups which each used large whiteboards and post-its to group ideas under how the user feels, what they do, what they say, and what they think. This step really helped me narrow into an understanding of what we might need to make, without focusing yet on the actual product. 
    </p>

<br>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Later we ranked ideas based on the user's needs by feasibility and how necessary they were to the user. Ideas that were infeasible or unnecessary were marked "unwise," and eliminated. Ideas that were pretty feasible and high on the user's needs were titled "big bets." Ideas that were super feasible but lower on the user's wish-list were "utilities." Finally, one or two ideas that were very feasible and also high priority for the user were called "no brainers." Doing this gave us a more manageable range of possibilities for our project. This led to the following step, prototyping to decide. This is when we started by using only popsicle sticks, tape, and paper clips. Then we tried again, this time using string, pipe cleaners, and rubber bands. Fluctuating materials gave us insight to what worked, what didn't, and what could work. I also gained more appreciation for cardboard, which is what we used in the next step. Cardboard is malleable, but can hold its shape. We ended up prioritizing a lift/push motion to assist the user in leaving the chair. We also included a cupholder, and a reclining function that attached to the lift/push mechanism. Materials that were used the most in this project were cardboard, tape, and string. 
    </p>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        While the prototype was in no way effective, nor was it aesthetic, it proved that certain mechanics could work. A note from the professors on this subject:

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        My partner and I worked to create a Prusa Mini+ 3D printer in ENGR 11A. To begin, they opened the box and separated the parts from the packing equipment. Large parts included the Y axis and the X/Z axis. The kit also included the charger and power supply, as well as the filament sensor. Small parts included the two allen keys and the multi-wrench. P (referring to my partner) and I largely combined our efforts for this step. It was pretty clear as to what parts were where, although it wasn’t as clear as I may have liked as to which screws were where. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        The next step was to prep the printer. This was done by putting sticky foam on the bottom of the XZ axis, and also removing cover on the electronics box on the Y axis. This step was fairly easy and both P and I completed this step. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Following this step, the manual recommended assessing the locations of the connection holes. At this point, P and I were prepared to screw the pieces together. However, as the manual suggested not to, they did not, though some concern was expressed with how the screw might reach through from the Y axis to the XZ axis. At this point, it was necessary to move the Y axis motor cable, which worked well. However, it appeared that the cable needed further manipulation once it was connected to the XZ axis. The same applies to the LCD cable, which was also moved to prep for connection of the two main parts.
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In Phase 1 of connecting the parts, it was extremely difficult to push the motor cable through the hole. Skipping ahead to the LCD cable, this was also difficult to push through, as the casing is not pliable enough, and the LCD cable especially is too large. If I were to edit anything here, I would make the hole bigger, or create pliable flaps on either side of the hole. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In Phase 2 of connecting the parts, we did not realize that the Y axis would need to be pushed all the way to the back. This caused an issue when we overtightened the screws, causing the Y axis to become stationary in the wrong position. I took the lead in tightening the screws, while P worked to position everything. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        One other problem that we encountered here was tightening the longest screw. The issue was that the shaft was so long that we couldn’t properly tighten the longest screw. When sticking the allen wrench into the shaft, Myself and P had difficulty locking the end of the wrench into the screw. One way that I might resolve this would be by using a screw with the same length of threads, but a longer solid shaft. Another way to fix this might be creating an indent on the outside of the Y axis, providing a shorter hole. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        P took the lead on connecting the LCD as they were able to push the cable hand tight. There were no issues attaching the LCD, though it would be helpful for the manual to describe the proper orientation, so that it would not get in the way of the Y axis while it was calibrating. The visualization for connecting the Y axis motor cable was very helpful, though it might be furthered by ensuring the cable was coming into the wire box through the hole correctly as well. Connecting the heatbed cable and filament sensor also did not pose a problem. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Covering the electronics was a bit more challenging. In this step it was essential to have all of the wires fit through the cut-outs in the plastic cover. This required some maneuvering, as the wire protectors were pretty thick.
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        This marks the end of the building of the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer. We also set up the spool holder and attempted to calibrate, though due to a machine entanglement and the system freezing, we were unable to start a 3D print on that day. 
    </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Next, In our third class, we focused on creating the torture test 3D benchys, altering them in CAD, and then working on our websites. We spent some time reviewing best practices for creating code in Bootstrap. Then we discussed CSS, which is used for style, and w3schools. In my opinion, a sticking point that could be covered more thoroughly is connecting sublime to bootstrap. Also, inserting images can be difficult. After reviewing domain definitions and functions, we began printing.
    </p>
    </body>
<html>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        We used Thingiverse --> 24 Thing Files to open up the benchys. A benchy is a mini tugboat that does not float, but tests the functions of the 3D printer. After creating the benchy, you can measure the actual result against the website to determine the accuracy of your printer. Our challenge was to create the benchy in as little time as possible. Originally, this print would take 1 hour and 17 minutes. I originally considered using the common ratio math to decrease the factors in the horizontal shell settings, but I abandoned this as it didn't significantly change the duration. Instead, we decreased the fill density from 15% to 7.5%, changed the fill pattern from grid to gyroid, with monotonic lines on top and bottom fill, and all these changes decreased the time to 55 minutes. However, my partner and I realized that the easiest way to decrease the duration of a build is to make it smaller. So we did! We decreased the benchy size by 50%, which brought the time down to 36 minutes. This created a nearly perfect, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> mini </FONT> benchy! Some things we did notice were excessive stringing, and zits. This is mainly caused by moist filament, as our climate is relatively humid, this is to be expected. Some things we iterated for our next print were turning on speed, increasing the nozzle temp, and turning on ooze prevention. Since printing the mini took so little time, we were also able to print a regular sized boat, with fewer strings and blobs.

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            In order to increase our comfort level with Prusa and CAD, we got to print our own model, anything we wanted. I chose a shell pot. I had considered many different models, including a taco, jewelry, and decorative pieces, but in the end I chose the Shell Pot, because as a holder it's functional, with the purple PLA we used it was aesthetic, and it had a pattern that would look nice with the natural ridges of the print. After it was printed, we were tasked with creating a day-long print, something larger and more intricate to run for a longer period of time. I thought that I wanted to create something functional, and I really like tacos, so I chose to make a cord taco. Theoretically, it would look like a taco shell, with some flowy exterior parts for the taco filling, and a semi-cylindrical hole through the middle.

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Update: My print is finished! And it looks awesome. Aesthetically, using a filament with a multi-color gradient really elevated the design. The texture is an interesting prism feel, which I had not done on purpose, but I do see that the original model I uploaded for the body was prismatic. It's very stringy, but that is related to the temperature of the environment. This could be compensated for by editing the extruder temperature, but that wouldn't actually decrease the stringiness by a substantial amount, which I've seen in previous prints. The cut-out worked wonderfully, one thing that I'm not sure about is why the underneath looks so messy. 
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Project 2
        </p>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        I knew that I wanted to create something with many stationary parts. I also wanted to make something decorative, as I noticed that other engineering students either made something functional or decorative. My previous design, though fun, served the purpose of holding cords. I chose a pot for the base of my design, shown <a href="https://www.freepik.com/3d-model/round-pot-001_3395.htm#&position=8&from_view=search">here.</a> From there, I used multiple different shape functions, including a freeform creator, to make the pot look like a cat in a witch hat. Then I used a semi-circle and some beveled octagons to make a small lid that looks like a pumpkin lid. The freeform creator was interesting. I can see how it's a good idea, and I noticed another student using it to create a neat decoration for their design. However, my main issue was that my design is rounded all the way through, so anything I create with the freeform editor will stick out. I opted out of using it, though I wanted to create a mouth for my cat. I didn't really find anything that would work well for that. Sometimes the best choice is to just scrap something once you've exhausted your resources. In my case, I used up too much time. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Another resource that was limited turned out to be USBs. We ended up borrowing some from larger printers that weren't in use. Again, since I spent a lot of time on the small details in my design, I only had one printer that I could use. So I chose to print the smaller lid, which I knew was as good as I was going to get it, whereas I wanted to tweak my main cat pot more. It's important to note that since I'm printing two separate parts at two separate times, I increased the scale of the one on the printer to a round 300%. I fit the two pieces together in TinkerCAD, but if I accidentally sliced one at a 345%, which might best optimize space on the plate, the other print might not fit on the plate at that scale, and I'd have to reprint the first one so they fit together. Though I didn't make this mistake, realizing that this was a possibility made me understand how important it is to think three steps of your design. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        After class, I decided to create an engraving on the bottom of my design. This presented multiple challenges. If it wasn't on the right level in comparison to the print and the plate, it wouldn't print properly. I also had to be careful of the "holes" on the inside of the pot. What I mean by this is that I had to attach some things to the outside of the pot which put material on the inside of the pot, which would theoretically be completely hollow. To combat this I put multiple shapes on the "hole" setting which makes the shape hollow, to hollow out the inside of the pot. Back to the engraving, another difficulty I ran into was not being able to see some gaps in CAD. I had to put my design through the slicer 8 times before I had no gaps or discrepancies. 
        </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">Key Takeaway: Triple check your work in the slicer before you attempt to print! Some of your details may look "stuck" in CAD, but in the slicer they're a millimeter away and won't print on your design. </FONT>
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
         I was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of the supports. Using tree supports on a lower setting worked really well. By this I mean that the Prusa has a sensitivity, where it'll add supports if the tilt or overhang is at a certain degree. Lowering this sensitivity told the printer to print less supports, but keeping them in certain places to avoid the squiggly under-pattern. One unexpected issue was the lid not fitting well. In CAD, I made the lid the same size as the openning, which printed a lid the same size of the openning. This means it doesn't actually fit, not too big and not too small, it just doesn't fit. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
         Update: I printed a new lid, this time with the smooth, extruded top. It came out wonderfully, but the natural supports supporting the brim on the bottom proved difficult to remove. One way that I could iterate this in the future would be to use paint-on supports, which would require more time to learn the function properly before I can use it. I did take a few minutes to attempt using paint on supports in case I couldn't remove the supports, but I didn't have much success. Luckily, though the supports were very close together and difficult to remove, I was able to discard them all. I'm very happy with how this one came out, and I look forward to seeing it as a decoration. 
         <br>
         <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff"> Key Takeaway: I believe that iteration and innovation strike a delicate balance. You should know when to try to fix something and when to start over, and exhaust all your possible solutions before trying to create something new with additive manufacturing.</FONT>

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Project 3
        </p>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            For this project, we were tasked with creating an alarm clock. The first step was to solder resistors to the board. These pieces serve the purpose of sound, lights, and interactive buttons. We learned proper methods for soldering safely and efficiently. The main instruction was to touch the tip to the object you’re heating, then touch the solder flux to the tip and allow it to melt around the “pin”, which is the prong of the resistor. I had some difficulty with this at first, and I realized that in order to melt the solder I should keep both the tip and the solder on the same side of the prong. After surpassing that learning curve, I was largely able to solder the rest of the resistors. One thing that was slightly difficult was knowing which resistors went where. To combat this, the board had a silk screen, which is essentially an outline of each part and its number. This was very helpful. Another thing we had to be careful to avoid were bridges. These occurred when the solder for one resistor dripped over to the other resistor, forming a bridge of flux. In order to correct this, there were two options. One was to use the “undo button,” which sucks up the flux in that area, or touch the tip to the bridge and it will evaporate. We also needed to keep track of the positive and negative pins. The longer lead is always positive, which meant we lined it up with the positive marking on the silk screen. This was also super helpful in ensuring that we wouldn’t need to redo the project. Finally, we measured the board so my partner and I could begin to design the case for the alarm clock. The board is 39.3 mm tall and 88.55 mm long, so we needed to add on a few millimeters so that we have more tolerance for fit. <FONT COLOR="#17A589">A note from the TA on the subject: “Don’t let perfection be the enemy of good.”</FONT>
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Next, we printed the front and back for the alarm clock board, then the back for the changeable calendar. The calendar gave very little trouble, however it was pretty tricky to fit the interface to a case. We measured everything to the 10th of a millimeter, as the PRUSA wouldn't detail smaller than that anyway. From the left edge of the first number to the right edge of the last one measured 80 mm, so the hole for seeing the numbers was created for 81 mm. Similarly, the diameter for the buzzer was created at 11.8 mm, while the actual buzzer diameter was 11.4 mm. We continued onward with that framework, overestimating our measurements. We printed three iterations of our front cover, and stopped with the third, which was the most satisfactory. However, we aren't able to manufacture a way to push the buttons into the frame. So, I created a small "wand" to meet this need. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            My favorite part of this project was the drawer. Since we were using the idea of interchangeable numbers, we'd need somewhere to store the numbers not in use. A drawer that the clock and calendar interface stand on further drives home the idea of a book. We also added a slot in the top of the drawer case to slide the battery in and out of, for easy storage and minimal wire-pinching. The follow-through of this idea was a little flawed, as I made the back of the drawer case so thick that the drawer itself wouldn't push back enough to slide the battery or battery connector comfortably. To combat this, rather than create a completely new print, I extended the wires by splicing and soldering three inches of wire to the plates on the circuit board, then soldering them to the original end of the wires connecting to the battery. This was so that there was plenty of room to detach and reattach the battery <i>inside</i> the drawer. As you can see from the pictures, the drawer printed with EXCESSIVE supports. This is due to printing with automatic supports on the Raise printer. Automatic supports print a 3 mm pillar on a 40 degree overhang. To make the supports less overdone in the future, I can change the setting to a 1.5 or 2.0 mm pillar and a 75 to 90 degree overhang. Also, Raise has the option to erase or add supports as you'd like, which is a feature I will absolutely be using in the future. I also created an indent on the top of the drawer to "lock" the clock and calendar in. This wasn't an <i>unqualified</i> success, exactly, as it required some post-processing. After filing down the edges to widen the gap and shrink the frames, the notches at least held the pieces in place. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Finally, the numbers. I was expecting these to be a pain point, however, Fusion360 has the option to create a sketch that is a text box, then extrude the number, and push/pull faces to change their size slightly in order to make them fit. Once I made my first number, three more came pretty easily. They also printed very nicely. What stopped me from printing several numbers was time. If I had another week to devote to trying different combinations to get each possible date to fit on the calendar, I'd happily do so. However, for the purpose of this assignment, I printed the four numbers for the due date (with natural supports to hold up the pegs; printing the 0 twice because one peg didn't fit properly) and demonstrated how they were interchangeable. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            At last, Project Three was complete. The hardest part for me were points of connection. Pegs are thin and breakable, but necessary for attaching things quickly. Working with a partner on a creative project was a great experience. One thing I didn't expect was the complications involved in taking an idea from your imagination, conveying it to your partner, and then inputting it to the computer. My greatest triumph in terms of this project was increased confidence on Fusion360. From being completely unable to navigate the program to expanding to finer detailing and shortcuts, my comfort level has skyrocketed, thanks to support from our TA and resident Fusion experts. <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff"> Key Takeaway: Measure twice, slice three times, and print four times. But truly, looking at a project on each level and ensuring that you have room for error is critical.</FONT>

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            For this project, we worked to create a generic, open source prosthetic hand. I started with downloading the enABLE Phoenix V3 hand. I imported this to the Raise 3D printer, which I had only used once briefly before. My first reaction to the CAD program for the Raise was a more friendly UX in comparison to Prusa. The main options; scale, rotate, move, cut, duplicate, and support, were all clearly labelled and accessible in the toolbar. I scaled the entire project by 150% so that the pieces would be easier to connect. However, at this size, not every piece would fit in the Raise. So, I printed the small pieces (proximals, snap pins, tensioner blocks and pins) on the prusa plate, leaving the arm guard, distal, and palm to print on the Raise. This worked well, and I was able to create an interesting gradient on the fingers with multicolored filament on the Prusa. The other part of this assignment was to create an adaptation to the hand to increase the experience of a user. I chose to create "training wheels," by cutting out a semicircle on the bottom of the palm, and inserting an axis. I had to do this in TinkerCAD, though not for lack of trying in Fusion360. Ultimately, I chose this quicker route because the palm mesh had too many triangles; I'd need to decimate in MeshMixer, then attempt to convert back, then try to alter and add to the palm. My limited resource was time, so TinkerCAD was my tool. I completed this adaptation and printed it. I had been having some issues realizing the actual size of objects from CAD to reality, so I was quite suprised by how small the axis for my wheel was.
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Additionally, I also scaled the wheel to 100%, making them roughly 30 millimeters. This was far to large for the hand, and I realized that as soon as the first layer printed. I stopped the print, and replaced it with a scaled 10% wheel as well as caps. From here, I measured the space for the wheels on the adapted hand at [INSERT MEASUREMENTS] and printed accordingly. This wasn't the only mistake I learned here; I also printed the original hand with supports, which clogged the channels. Essentially, I was interested in rushing an adapted print, and so focused on creating that adaptation (which did need supports in CAM) that I did not consider the original function and needs of the print. So I needed to reprint the palm as well, being careful to only allow supports around the axis. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            When assembling the hand, we utilized <a href="https://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/dd/6b/45/30/fc/Phoenix_v2_assembly_guide.pdf">these written instructions</a>. They were very helpful, because they showed to-scale comparisons of each pin along with labels so that we knew exactly which one went where. The other helpful aspect were pictures throughout. We chose to use written instructions for this part rather than a video because it was easier to go quickly through easy steps and look more carefully at more complicated ones. Finally, these instructions were useful because they included additional tips, such as using a pair of pliers to push in pins, or providing context for certain parts by mentioning what purpose the spacing or location would serve in the future. A few downsides included the general fact that the manual was for version 2, as there isn't an official manual for v3. This didn't create many setbacks, aside from some momentary confusion of a whippletree and a tensioner block (the former exclusive to v2, the latter in our kit). If I were to make any improvements, I'd replace many of the assembly pictures that are in CAD with some from real finished prints.  
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            After the pieces were put together and the rubber bands were placed, we needed to string the tension lines. For this step, we switched over to video format. This seemed to be a better idea to follow along in real time. My partner and I believed that we wouldn't be inhibited by the playback speed being different than our speed, as we could play/pause, and we could follow the movements of the builder and have a camera view on exactly what needs to be done. We used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwjOn18uO1I">this video</a>, from approximately 40:00 to 1:07:00. For this video, some of the tips shared verbally were helpful, but I feel as though for the majority I could've followed along just as well with no audio. Two things confused me in this video: the creator removed and replaced the tensioner pins, and never specified the size (or gauge) of the string. This was espescially puzzling, as the kit included two kinds of string. Other than those items, the video was concise (if a bit slow for my taste) and helpful. One other challegen separate from a mistake on my part in printing was presented in the form of hardware scale. The screws included in the kit were 5/8", and the holes were slightly too large, preventing the screws from "gripping." This was because the print was scaled to 150%, while the kit hardware was not. We could reprint the tensioner block to have 100% scale holes, or use larger screws. We had many larger screws in the classroom, so we used that option. Personally, if the holes had to be the wrong size I'd rather they be too small so I'd have an excuse to try out the classroom's tap and die set.

            Update: The second iteration of the palm failed, with a spectacular layer shift. This was an overall fail, however, I was able to learn that the supports on build plate only worked decently. Other than that issue, I was able to put together the rest of the hand with borrowed parts and will remake the hand with my adaptation in the future, to satisfy my own curiosity.

            In our fifth project, we were required to use the laser cutter to create fitted boxes for our alarm. This time, we needed to think further about fitting pieces together. The biggest difference between laser cutting and printing is that tolerance is nearly obsolete when printing on a laser cutter. <FONT COLOR="#17A589">A note from the TA on the subject: “It's a laser, Avery. It's exact to the nanometer. You're not going to need 3 millimeter tolerance.”</FONT> To begin, I reviewed the video provided. Through that video, I got some good ideas regarding tooth-hole joining, but I feel like there was a lot of extra information. For instance, though parameters are helpful to keep things uniform, it was also helpful for me to set up my own tabs each time. I also prefer to be not as constrained. What I mean by this is if I set up parameters, I wouldn't as easily be able to add or move tabs singularly. Another choice that I made was to extrude each of my sketches so that I could easily manipulate something that looked like my final project. I would replicate this process in the future, but I think that I would have the spatial reasoning skills to complete the assignment without extrusion. Additionally, I have leveled up in terms of comfort on Fusion360 such that this project was more simple and less frustrating. I am actually able to help classmates with parts of the project! 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            I created my sketch as a series of rectangles, and chose to create a much longer back, along with a top that was more of a shelf, so that the alarm clock could also double as a holder for a phone! Some issues that I ran into were keeping everything fit properly before cutting, in hopes that things would stay aligned in cutting. Once I surmounted the issue of over constraining sketches (mostly by again, removing parameters and replacing them with my own measurements for each individual line). Something that worked really well was using the push/pull option. It would work in instances extrusion would not, and allowed for quick, exact alterations in fit of the tabs and holes for the tabs. Additionally, I chose to use holes rather than intruded pegs to fit my pieces together. This was because slots will hold better than teeth and I was prioritizing durability so that I'd be able to add a shelf to the clock box. 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Finally, it was time to laser cut my design! This was exciting. In preparation, I downloaded Lightburn, which might be compared to Ideamaker. It has a user-friendly interface in which you can also add simple shapes. For me, it's a little hard to create exact images in Lightburn, but when transporting from Fusion360 to the laser cutting, it works wonderfully. I'm able to reliably move the CAD around on the printer bed to anticipate the laser's path. One limit to both Lightburn and the cutter can be seen in an attempt to have the laser start somewhere other than the top right so that we could reuse the board in its current position. I did some crude measurement and put my design in Lightburn just under the cut-out left behind by the previous cut. However, since there isn't any way to measure exactly in the cutter (no grid or tick marks along the edges) I put my design too close and ended up with a little more cut out then I intended on one piece. This wasn't a failure, though, as I was able to use that piece anyway. Some fails were caused by poor spatial reasoning: the triangle supports under the shelf required a lot of reconfiguring, tabs weren't placed close enough to one face or another, didn't pass through the hole as much as they should, or otherwise caused gaps. One other issue was caused by not having the tabs centered: one "tooth" was shifted slightly higher than the other, causing the side to push awkwardly. Finally, I made the mistake of creating a clock face hole that was firstly too small, then had no way to be secured. I used the push/pull feature to fix the first problem, then used our TA's design as a model to create a sort of gate to keep the board from falling out of the front.

            The Myra laser cutter works with a 700 x 450 bed, and we were cutting a 3 mm piece of plywood. The laser parks on the rear right, and we have full ventilation towards the back of the machine. When cutting, the laser is at 100% power and 20% speed. In case of emergency in which the ventilation doesn't do its job of controlling the burning, we keep a spray bottle of water nearby and can pause the cut at any time. With these precautions in place, I had a great time iterating my design until it fit around my clock nicely.

            This project requires us to create an open-source prosthesis for an actual client! We separated into teams of 2 to 4, and created a goal, team norms, and a gameplan. My team included three others, whom I'll refer to as GO, RC, and JL, and we focused on creating an upper-limb prosthesis for a military veteran. The first thing that we focused on was team roles and goals. We filled out a Collaboration Agreement, which you can see a censored version of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1imkLhWiNxXPH8sAHjVsy2w6rUHidw6Wnab513zHIUg4/edit">here.</a> Following that, we got to work on outreach. We began with general searches for "disabled veteran organizations," "veteran prosthetics," "veteran hospitals," "prosthetic labs," and the like. We ended up contacting over twenty places, between phone calls and emails. Our email template can be seen in my Gallery, along with a visual of the chart we used to attempt to keep track of who we contacted. Unfortunately, we ended up contacting many prospective clients or organizations asynchronously, and the chart was not consistantly adhered to. This made the process slightly more difficult, because we could not verify that we had already contacted someone that we were referred to later. Finding a client was extremely difficult. We were constrained by bureaucracy; we were told constantly that the person we contacted initially wasn't able to help us, but might know someone and would pass the message along. We had over a week to secure a client, and we were not able to do so in that timeline. The most productive lead we had (and the only one that went beyond "I'll leave a message with Other Person.") was  a Brandeis alumni who is now a manager in the Marine Corps. He suggested some new organizations that we had not considered, and we have now reached out to the Wounded Warrior project and a veteran's homeless shelter. Even though we didn't end that phone call with a customer, it was encouraging to hear from someone else that our project was worthwhile.

        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            While we were searching for a client, we got to work on ideas for a product. We used a "says thinks does feels" chart and an impact vs feasibility chart (pictures of which will be in my gallery.) to decide what kinds of adaptations should be made to  a simple upper arm prosthesis. We chose to use the Arm v2 from Thingiverse, and print it on the Raise E2. This arm was simple, but had enough moving parts (wrist, fingers) that my team and I could identify areas for improvement. It was important for us to start off with an open-source model before adapting anything, because we all wanted a clear visual to talk out our ideas with. It would take more than one Prusa build plate to complete, so I chose to use the Raise. I did not make any changes to the file in CAD because the goal of this step is to determine feasibility of a variety of ideas, and assess shortcomings of what arms are already on open source. So far, we have decided on two adaptations: individually moveable fingers and a weighted arm. Both of these have high impact, while moveable fingers have a much lower feasibility. However, I am confident we can achieve both. For now, I am using all normal settings and a 100% scale to print the arm. We used PLA 1.75 because again, we just wanted to use the basic model and improve from there. I included some manual supports where needed, which is an easy-to-use feature on Ideamaker. For most pieces, using a 75 degree overhang for the automatic supports works well to add sufficient supports but not so many that I would spend an inordinate amount of time and energy on post-processing. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            While we were waiting for the above arm to print, my team decided to print another arm of a much different variety. This new arm was smoother, required less hardware, and had a greater emphasis on comfort and aesthetics. We wanted to test out this arm in PET-G for its strength and resistance to everyday bending. When this material does break, it shatters, which isn't a great fail state, however, we can combat this with a sleeve made of TPU, or NinjaFlex, which is incredibly bendy and rubbery. Creating this arm proved a stretch of my abilities, as there were two options to upload onto Ideamaker: put the entire arm on at once, which "sticks" each component together, so I couldn't manipulate each individual piece. The other option was to import each piece separately, which is what I ended up doing. After over an hour of manipulating components and supports, my comfort with Ideamaker is at an all-time high.

            At the time of publishing this write-up, our team has a solid lead from another team in our classroom, who might have another client that we can work with. If they do not, we can continue to document our process with the imagined client, and the goal to create a proportionately weighted arm with individual finger movements. We have one prototype printing in PLA and one ready to be printed in PET-G (with PLA supports). <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">Key Takeaway: Have a backup plan! Your initial goal might be unachievable due to time or resource constraints, but that does not mean you can't move the goalposts or pivot your vision. </FONT>

            For this project, we needed to create a product that the "client" would use. Since we didn't have a clearly defined client, we're focusing on two problems: controlled finger movement and even weight distribution. Our plan for this is to create a "ratchet" mechanism for one of the fingers to start with and also add small water containers to the gauntlets. That's the overview of our goal for this project. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            We split our team into two defined workflows: one for the weight and one for the finger. I worked solely on the finger. One of my teammates is also using my sketch of the finger to try to create an adaptable fingertip, which could have a sort of glove mechanism which would slip on and transform the tip of the finger to a knife or other helpful tool. I was focused on the other end of the finger, with the pin and proxy. The proxy is the small two-sided piece that attaches the finger to the hand at the joint. My plan is to turn the rounded joint on the end of the finger into a negative of a gear, and the rounded end of the proxy into a gear. You can see this more clearly in the gallery. Essentially, this would allow the finger to "click" at certain settings. So, my first iteration was a to-size finger, which I drew from scratch (as downloading the original finger for the arm we printed produced a mesh, which can't be adapted) and the proxy-turned-gear. The gear, as well as the pins, were extremely difficult to print. Firstly, they didn't lie flat on the plate. Then the supports were messy and impossible to remove. Then I discovered that the slicer had a copy of each proxy lying on top of the original. This severely affected the quality of the print, but once I fixed all of those issues, I had printed my own kit for the hand and arm. I did this out of PLA, since PLA is cheaper and in large supply. I planned to iterate with PLA until I was fully ready to create a "perfect" product, either our finished product or the second-to-last. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Sadly, my use of supports on the arch of the finger created a pretty messy print. To fix this, I needed to decrease the overhang threshold from the traditional 50% to closer to 20%, or less. Something that I realized here was that the difference in generated supports increases dramatically from 0-20%, but there's little to no change from 20% to 100%, unless you have a giant print with lots of 90 degree overhangs. I was able to ignore the "fuzz" leftover from the supports and focus on the gear, but I quickly realized the to-size print was too small for proper analysis of the gear, which seemed to not work properly, or line up. So I made a second iteration, which was 200% larger than the first. I'm not sure if I should call this an iteration, as it was necessary for the continuation of the project, but in no way something that would be given to the client, or used for anything more than observation. Nonetheless, as you can see in the gallery, I was able to determine that my original idea for a moving gear and stationary return (the part that the gear fits into) was doomed from the beginning. My professor snapped off the cover of the gear mechanism so that I could see what was happening, and not only was the gear not spinning, because it had nothing to spin with; but it was also the wrong shape to fit into the return. To elaborate: when you have two gears on a round pivot, they can each spin against each other, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise, and whatever's attached to one end can move nicely all the way around. If one of the gears doesn't turn, though, then it rotates <i>around</i> the second gear. For the second problem of the gear type, the teeth of the gear flare out in a way that they'd only fit into the return if you slid them in on the z axis, like a puzzle piece. There's no way to change the position through rotation, only from picking it out and putting it back down. This gave me the idea of a sort of screw in the center of the gear. Imagine unscrewing a screw: it lifts up. If I could find a way to turn it back down in a different position, I might be able to reuse the same gear pattern. Since I can't figure out a way to do that, and really don't have the time for it, I'm shifting my gears. (Pun intended.)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            My next idea depends largely on that upward shifting/rotating movement. To make a joint stationary, you can place a tab, like a small cube, on the bottom of one of the pieces, and create a recess on the piece underneath it to hold the block. If you didn't want the block to stay in the hole, you could make the hole look more like a "v", where the edges flare out at a 120 degree angle rather than a 90 degree. This way, the finger can shift up, rotate to a set position, and settle back in. I'm not sure how to facilitate this best in the full system, that's iteration four! For now, I'm printing the top and bottom pieces to determine if that will work at all. There will be one final iteration, number 5, in which the finger will be printed out of PLA, the gear out of PET-G to minimize wearing damage, and the tip of the finger most likely NinjaFlex. At this time, I am printing iteration number 3, with a different CAD file. As soon as I receive the print, I will iterate in CAD for functionality one last time, and then change material from PLA to PET-G and NinjaFlex.

            <FONT COLOR="#a4485b"> Personal note: Working on Fusion again!!! I enjoyed the short break, but nothing is euphoric like finally getting the CAD to do what you wanted it to...finally...at 1 am.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">Key Takeaway: Understand how long each iteration will take. Sure, the print time might be at one hour, but it will take ten or so minutes to slice the gcode, locate or establish a working, loaded printer, have it probe and heat, then finally begin printing. There are a dozen little things that can go wrong in preparing to print, and the reason I'm not on iteration four right now is due to either a shortage of loaded, working printers or last minute issues in slicing.</FONT>
